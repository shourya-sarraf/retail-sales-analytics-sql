# Net Sales Calculation Logic

The net sales calculation is performed in multiple stages to accurately
reflect real-world retail pricing and discount structures.

## Step 1: Base Sales
Sales quantity is multiplied with gross price to calculate gross sales.

## Step 2: Pre-Invoice Discount
A pre-invoice discount is applied based on customer and fiscal year
agreements.

## Step 3: Post-Invoice Discount
Additional discounts and deductions are applied at the product and
transaction date level.

## Step 4: Final Net Sales
Net sales are derived after applying both pre-invoice and post-invoice
discounts.

This layered calculation approach ensures accurate revenue reporting
and supports reusable, scalable analytics.
